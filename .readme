This is the Workflow Course Assignment, showing that I am proficient in E2E and Unit Testing, and tailoring my workflow.

## Description

The workflow process uses a lot of different tools to make the job of developing a functional website more consistent, and significantly easier in many regards.
Tests using software like Jest and Cypress configured correctly make a developer's life a lot easier in reproducing errors, and patching them.
